# EDM preferences form

This form is built (using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) and then included in the Jekyll site:

https://parksaustralia.gov.au/edm-preferences/

Once the site is rebuilt in Gatsby/React then this for code can move into the main site repository.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`

Currently we copy the contents of `build` folder to [this location](https://github.com/envris/parksaustralia/tree/master/edm-preferences/form).
